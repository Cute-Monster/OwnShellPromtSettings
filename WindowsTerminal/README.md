# Windows Terminal settings 

Firstly you should install `Windows Terminal` or `Windows Terminal Preview` for Windows Store. 

After installing open it and press `Ctr + ,` to open settings menu. When navigate to botom left corner and press it to open `settings.json` with associated editor. 

When file is opened find its full-path location and replace it with this file. Another way is to copy [file content](./settings.json) and replace source content with it...
